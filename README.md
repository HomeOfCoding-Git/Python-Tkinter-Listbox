# Python-Tkinter-Listbox

This project is about interacting with the listbox from the python 3.8 tkinter library.
The listbox is illustated through a "Notes mock-up app".
This mock-up app is not for production, of which is outside the scope of this tutorial.

Updated:
If "Notes" and "CSV" directories do NOT exist, auto populate.
